## üìù Project Description

This is an interactive web-based tool designed to measure a user's **Target Acquisition Time**. It's a fun and challenging game that tests a combination of pure cognitive reflex (perceiving a stimulus) and motor skill (moving the mouse to the target). The application presents a minimalist UI where a target appears at a random location after a random delay. The user's goal is to click the target as quickly as possible.


## üåü Key Features

-   **Dynamic Target Generation:** The target appears at a random X/Y coordinate on the screen after a randomized delay to keep the user engaged and provide a true test of reaction.
-   **Millisecond-Precision Timing:** Uses the JavaScript `Date.now()` method to accurately measure the time from target appearance to a successful click.
-   **Full Game State Machine:** The app cycles through clean states (`start`, `waiting`, `ready`, `result`) using React Hooks to manage the entire game flow.
-   **Score Tracking:** Saves the last five scores and displays a running average, allowing users to track their performance over time.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** Features a professional, reusable `<Footer>` component for easy maintenance and a clean codebase.

## üíª Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React.js, Vite
-   **Icons:** `react-icons` for the footer.
-   **Core Logic:** Pure JavaScript (`useState`, `useRef`, `setTimeout`, `Date.now()`)
-   **Styling:** Pure CSS3 for the minimalist UI, animations, and layout.
-   **Deployment:** Vercel
